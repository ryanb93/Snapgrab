Original Snapchat saving application written for rooted Android devices. Released: 	April 18, 2013

Source code was lost between transfers so this source is decompiled from the APK file. In it's current state it can not be built, even if it could - Snapchat have updated their code so that the method used to save images and videos no longer works.

Instructions
---

* Open Snapchat.
* Let new snaps download but don't open.
* Switch to Snapgrab.
* Tap 'Import Images' button.
